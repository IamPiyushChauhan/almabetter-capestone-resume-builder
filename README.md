# Project Description

The "Resume Builder" is a web application that allows users to create and manage their resumes easily. With this application, users can leverage the free templates provided by resume builders to create professional-looking resumes. The process is simple: users can select a template from the available options, fill out the required information, and download the finalized resume as a PDF document.

## Key Features

1. **Template Selection**: The application offers a variety of pre-designed resume templates for users to choose from. Each template is visually appealing and designed to highlight different aspects of a resume.

2. **Resume Creation**: Users can enter their personal information, such as contact details, work experience, education and skills required for their specific industry or job application. The application provides a user-friendly interface for inputting and organizing this information.

3. **Resume Management**: The application allows users to save and access their previously created resumes. Users can easily view and update their resumes whenever necessary, ensuring that they always have the most up-to-date version available.
